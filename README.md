# Homelab

The current state of my home compute and network environment is shocking. It consists of fibre
running from outside of the flat to a router provided by my ISP that supplies connectivity via
Wi-Fi to all of the connected devices that we own. I also make use of instances via AWS for 
any machines that I want to run, which is conventient, until you consider that a 4 vCPU / 
16GB RAM / 30GB `t3.xlarge` instance costs Â£142.00 per month.

The objective then is to build a proper network, deploy some computers and start working on
my craft from the comfort of a secure(ish) home network.

## Kit

The following is a list of the kit that I want to obtain for this:

- [ ] 1 x UniFi Cloud Gateway Ultra
- [ ] 1 x UniFi Lite 8 PoE 8 port switch
- [ ] 2 x UniFi U6 Mesh
- [ ] 3 x GEEKOM A8 Max Mini PCs with AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS CPUs
